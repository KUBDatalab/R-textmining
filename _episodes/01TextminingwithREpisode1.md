## R Markdown
##What is text mining?
Text mining refers to the use of digital tools to enable automatized analyses of text data. These analyses can enable insight into a collection of texts that can be
difficult to spot with the naked eye. Furthermore, text mining tools allow the user to analyze large samples of texts and visualize the results

##Loading relevant libraries
We need to load some libraries that can perform the various steps in text analysis, because the base functions of R are not enough.

#Loading dataset




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


~~~
summary(cars)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     speed           dist       
 Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
 Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
 Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
 Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-pressure-1.png" alt="plot of chunk pressure" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
