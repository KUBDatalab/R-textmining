## R Markdown
##What is text mining?
Text mining refers to the use of digital tools to enable automatized analyses of text data. These analyses can enable insight into a collection of texts that can be
difficult to spot with the naked eye. Furthermore, text mining tools allow the user to analyze large samples of texts and visualize the results

##Loading relevant libraries
We need to load some libraries that can perform the various steps in text analysis, because the base functions of R are not enough.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
